  # The Debian sysv init script for isc-dhcp-server starts IPv4 and IPv6

  # must be set to the correct interface name, or else the server will fail.
  # The manual page says that the interfaces field should not be used unless
  # necessary.  There doesn't seem to be a wildcard value.  I don't want to
  # turn on fact gathering and try to plug in the correct interface name, here.
  # Just add "-4".  The IPv6 instance will fail noisily, and ansible
  # deployments won't be happy, but the server will function.
